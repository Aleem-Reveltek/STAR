# Summary

Today, I hosted a session on Facebook and WhatsApp to teach others about "STAR" and worked on a task assigned by boss to remove corporate personnel names from GitHub and upload 200 files. I also instructed my team to work on the Reveltek website and start adding comments on completed issues.

Today my focus on managing the team and improving communication skill and learning opportunities within the team. The tasks include hosting sessions about Reveltek website, discussing the project management process, giving training on the STAR method and Smart commit, adding members to the channel for better communication, and assigning team members to shadow experienced team members in order to learn and improve their skills. The goal is to complete milestones in an efficient manner.
