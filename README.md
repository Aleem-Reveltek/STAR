# Summary

Today, I hosted a session on Facebook and WhatsApp to teach others about "STAR" and worked on a task assigned by boss to remove corporate personnel names from GitHub and upload 200 files. I also instructed my team to work on the Reveltek website and start adding comments on completed issues.
