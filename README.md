# STAR

SMART STAR:

Space: Today, I'll teach Fajar about the SMART STAR, the 5 Ws, and the 5 Whys. I'll also show Lema how to set up meetings and how to share a screen.

Track: Today I'll learn about VS Code, how to create a Markdown file in VS Code, save it, and submit it to GitHub. I'll also learn about uploading images to GitHub, and I'll read the Essential Training Guide to learn more about ORBITAL.

Assist: Today, I'll organise sessions on Facebook and WhatsApp, study the Essential Training Guide, and chat to Muslim about joining our Facebook group. I'll also participate in the meeting with Mr. Hackney.

Reach: Today I will read the Essential Training Guide, host a session on Facebook and WhatsApp groups, learn about VS Code, and attend a meeting with Mr. Hackney. He informed me on Friday that we are an AI company and that when we hire new employees, we will inform them of this fact and the types of apps we have developed.
