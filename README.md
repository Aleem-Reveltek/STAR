The plan I came for today was to communicate on the Reveltek project and let new people know about the Reveltek company like which kind of Reveltek company is so that's why I created a meeting and in the 3:00 hours of meeting we talk about what Reveltek is and we research which kind of company's we can see who work like Reveltek so that's why we research and we search top 10 tech company's and we focus on character count and we did MVP, and I teach new people about Outlook like how to check Calendar and how to flag emails and I also quiz people on our Essential Training Guide.

**Assist:**

In Assist, we discuss how we can work on this project, so I tell them we are going to work on milestones. There were 10 issues open, so we started on those. We went through those issues and saw which ones were completed, so we started adding comments and creating pull requests. We also went through the files that were already uploaded to the repository and got some ideas for the navigation bar. I guess and teach new users how to use LinkedIn, such as how to respond to people on LinkedIn. I also teach them how to recover if they delete an email.

**Reach**

In Reach finally we research for navigation bar and we all communicate on that issue and we see that is character count same but character count was not matching so we use Open AI and we find alternative words like by using chat.GPT we get word like Agile organization to Agile org and we did our best in this project and after we get perfect character count we create smart commit and to day I join meeting with company owner and we learn about new STAR method and we also learn about how to create mermaid file and I just learn it and I make an impact on company by implementing on my SMART STAR.
